## Welcome

Welcome to Lab 8! Today, we'll focus on writing extensive `dplyr` code on larger data. We will both use the verbs individually and "write a sentence" with the verbs by stringing them together with pipes. 

### Learning objectives

-   Use `dplyr` verbs together with pipes on larger datasets. 

### Deliverables (i.e., what to put in the lab drop box)

Upload your rendered PDF (`lab_08.pdf`) **and** Quarto (`lab_08.qmd`) document to the lab drop box. Make sure the Quarto document properly renders to PDF.

### Collaborator(s)

List any collaborators you worked with below. 


## Exercise 0

Load any packages you'll need for this lab below.

```{r}

```


# Part 1: `pdxTrees`

# Wrap up

Congratulations! You've made it to the end of Lab 8. Make sure to render your final document and submit both the .pdf and .qmd file to D2L.
