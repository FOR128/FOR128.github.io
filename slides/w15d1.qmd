## Agenda

-   Quiz (1 - 9) make ups
-   Final project blog post: example
-   Final project slides: example
-   Quiz 11

## Quizzes

-   You can receive up to full points on two (2) quizzes that you did not get full points on. 
-   To do so, redo a Quiz on your own time and I will regrade it if you turn it in to me by the last day of class, Thursday Dec 5th, at 12:10pm. 
-   If you need an extra copy of a Quiz you'd like to make up, come see me. If you have your old copy, please write your new answers in a different colored pen/pencil, and specify why you initially got the problem wrong.
