## As a linear model

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

where $y_i$ is the final grade for the $i$th student in the class, and $x_i$ is the attendance rate of the $i$th student in the class. 

::: incremental

-   We estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, the intercept and slope of the "best fit" line.
-   We also calculate $R^2$, the proportion of variance in the student's final grade that can be explained by attendance.

#   group_by(Username) %>%
#   summarize(attendance_rate = (sum(score, na.rm = T) - 4) / 100,
#             final_grade = mean(final_grade)) %>%
#   lm(final_grade ~ attendance_rate, .) %>%
#   summary()
```

::: incremental

-   The estimate of the intercept: $\hat \beta_0 = 0.305$, 
-   The estimate of the slope: $\hat \beta_1 = 0.676$,
-   The proportion of variance explained by attendance: $R^2 = 0.699 \approx 0.7$
