## Engagement

::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="=50%"}
-   It has become harder and harder to stay focused over the last decade given the massive rise in wearable and mobile technology.

-   If you'll be using a laptop to take notes, please avoid distractions to yourself and classmates by silencing notifications and avoiding checking emails, news, social media, etc.

-   Please leave your phone on silent and put it somewhere where it won't distract you.

# Introductions {background-color="#00817c"}

In groups of \~3, introduce yourselves to each other.

(name, hometown, major, favorite food, etc.)

## About me

::: incremental
-   I'm Grayson, a PhD student in Forestry.

-   Before coming to Michigan State, I worked as a Data Scientist contracting for the USDA Forest Service.

-   Before that, I majored in Mathematics & Statistics at Reed College.

## About me

::: incremental
-   I `r emo::ji("heart")` teaching, especially about Data Science + Forestry.

-   In the past, I've co-directed a Forestry Data Science lab for undergraduates.

# Okay, but really, what *is* (Forestry) Data Science?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Creating dashboards, like this [Forestry Data Science Dashboard](https://ncasi-shiny-tools.shinyapps.io/Counties/)

```{r}
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dashboard.png")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Creating `R` packages, like `saeczi`, which an undergraduate wrote while doing Forestry Data Science research with me

#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("figs/saeczi.gif")
```

## Path to Forestry Data Science

::: incremental
-   Take this class and engage thoughtfully with the material. `r emo::ji("check")`

-   Take FOR 372 (offered this spring) to gain more domain-specific statistical expertise.

-   A wide variety of knowledge in statistics, computer science, and your domain field of expertise (forestry) is important.

-   Engage in undergraduate research opportunities!
:::

## Course goals

::: incremental
-   Getting to know your computer and using it thoughtfully
    -   Operating systems,
    -   files,
    -   directories,
    -   good naming conventions,
    -   file organization
:::

## Course goals

::: incremental
-   Learn how to use a variety of data science tools with forestry applications
    -   The `R` programming language,
    -   The RStudio IDE,
    -   Quarto (for reproducible reports)
-   Learn extensive `R` programming skills
    -   base `R` and `tidyverse` approaches
    -   data structures
    -   custom functions
    -   data wrangling & reshaping
    -   beautiful plots with `ggplot2`

# Course expectations: let's review the syllabus {background-color="#00817c"}

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)

## Syllabus: Materials

### Textbook: IFDAR

Introduction to Forestry Data Analysis with R, by Andrew O. Finley and Jeffrey W. Doser. *Available free, online:* [www.finley-lab.com/files/ifdar/](https://www.finley-lab.com/files/ifdar/)

### Technologies: `R`, RStudio, a laptop

R is a free and open source programming language, and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which allows for streamlined use of the R programming language. Both are free to install, and installation instructions will be provided in this course. A laptop that can run R and RStudio is required for this course.

## Syllabus: Meetings

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/schedule.png")
```

## Syllabus: Assessments

::: incremental
-   Lab reports (40%)
    -   Lab reports are assigned on Thursdays during lab time, and due the following Wednesday at 5pm on [D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu). We will have a lab each week (except for the week of the midterm exam).
-   Midterm Exams (20%)
    -   There will be two midterm exams, one on week 6 and one on week 12. Each midterm is worth 10% of the final grade.
-   In-class quizzes (15%)
    -   In-class quizzes do not have a regular schedule and will occur based on the material we get through.
:::

## Syllabus: Assessments

::: incremental
-   Lecture tickets (10%)
    -   Lecture tickets are due at the beginning of every lecture, handed in in-person, by you.
-   Final Project (15%)
    -   The details of the final project will be discussed as the semester goes on.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="=50%"}
-   "...a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to **thoughtfully, ethically, and independently** write code and extract knowledge from data"

-   AI tools are being used by others to *write code*, but as Data Scientists, we must write code *responsibly*

-   At this stage of learning how to code, AI tools inhibit learning and understanding.
