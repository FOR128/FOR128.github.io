# Introductions

In groups of ~3, introduce yourselves to each other. 

(name, hometown, major, favorite food, etc.)

## About me

::: {.incremental}
- I'm Grayson, a PhD student in Forestry. 

- Before coming to Michigan State, I worked as a Data Scientist contracting for the USDA Forest Service.

- Before that, I majored in Mathematics & Statistics at Reed College.

## About me

::: {.incremental}
- I `r emo::ji("heart")` teaching, especially about Data Science + Forestry.

- In the past, I've co-directed a Forestry Data Science lab for undergraduates.

# Okay, but really, what *is* (Forestry) Data Science? 

---

- Creating dashboards, like this [Forestry Data Science Dashboard](https://ncasi-shiny-tools.shinyapps.io/Counties/)

```{r}
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dashboard.png")
```

- Creating `R` packages, like `saeczi`, which an undergraduate wrote while doing Forestry Data Science research with me

knitr::include_graphics("figs/saeczi.gif")
```


## Path to Forestry Data Science 

::: {.incremental}
- Take this class and engage thoughtfully with the material. `r emo::ji("check")`

- Take FOR 372 (offered this spring) to gain more domain-specific statistical expertise.

- A wide variety of knowledge in statistics, computer science, and your domain field of expertise (forestry) is important.

- Engage in undergraduate research opportunities! 

:::


## Course goals 

::: {.incremental}

- Getting to know your computer
  - Operating systems, files, directories, paths, ...

- Using your computer thoughtfully
  - naming conventions, organization, ... 
  
- Learn how to program in `R` with the RStudio IDE
  - reproducibility
  - data structures
  - functions
  - the `tidyverse`
