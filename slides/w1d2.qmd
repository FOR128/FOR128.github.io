## Agenda

Today, we'll introduce a few topics

-   The `R` programming language
-   The RStudio IDE
-   Quarto, for reproducible reports
-   Navigating your computer: files, folders, and directories

# The `R` programming language

## The `R` programming language

-   talk about what R is and origins, uses, etc. 

## `R` as a calculator

-   `R` includes many mathematical operations, and is a great calculator. 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
2 + 3 # addition
2 * 3 # multiplication
2 / 3 # division
2 - 3 # subtraction
```

## `R` as a calculator

-   Functions exists for more complex mathematical operations

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
log(7) # the natural logarithm
log(7, base = 10) # log base 10
exp(7) # the exponential function
sqrt(7) # the square root function
abs(10 - 17) # absolute value
```

## `R` as a calculator

-   Functions can be nested in each other

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
log(exp(7))
```

## `R` as a calculator

-   Exponents with `^`: `2^3` means $2^3$

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
2^3
```



## What's going on here? 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(1)
```

::: incremental
-   `rnorm` is a *function*.
-   `1` is the value we gave to one of it's *arguments*.
-   We can type `?rnorm` for more information about the `rnorm` function.
-   Let's check it out!

:::

## What have we learned? 

::: incremental

- The `rnorm` function takes `n` random draws from a normal distribution with a center (`mean`) and spread (`sd`). 
  - These statistical details are not necessary for this class.

We could have written:

#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1)
```

We could have written:

#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1)
```

Or even:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## Arguments

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

::: incremental
-   `n` must be specified for `rnorm()` to run
-   `mean` and `sd` are optional, but if you don't specify them, `R` will choose for you (in this case, the defaults are `0` and `1`). 
:::

## Objects 

-   `R` can store objects in your global 

# The RStudio IDE

# Quarto: demo

# Navigating your computer
