## Agenda

Today, we'll introduce a few important data science tools:

-   The `R` programming language
-   The RStudio IDE
-   Quarto, for reproducible reports

## The `R` programming language: overview

::: incremental

-   `R` is an open source and freely available programming language with fully featured graphics.
-   `R` is a quite popular language, especially for scientific programming (but it does have lots of industry popularity, as well!).
- `R` is somewhat similar to `python` in syntax, and is a great first programming language to learn.

:::

## The `R` programming language: history

::: incremental

-   Initially, there was `S`. Developed by Bell Laboratories in the mid-70s. 
-   John Chambers, one of `S`'s primary developers described its purpose as follows: "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully".
-   `R` was developed in the early 90's and deals with many of the memory problems that existed in `S`.
-   Under the hood, `R` calls routines from the lower-level `FORTRAN` and `C` languages. 

:::

## RStudio

::: incremental

-   RStudio, or the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is a tool we'll use to run R code, edit reproducible reports, and even navigate our file system.
-   RStudio was initially released in 2011, and is the most popular IDE for `R` programming.
-   Largely, RStudio is a tool to code efficiently and reproducibly in the `R` programming language.
-   Let's take a look at it!

```{r}
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rstudio-ide.png")
```


## RStudio

-   RStudio has four panes: source, console, environment, and file manager. 



```{r}
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rstudio-ide.png")
```


## What's going on here? 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(1)
```

::: incremental
-   `rnorm()` is a *function*.
-   `1` is the value we gave to one of it's *arguments*.
-   We can type `?rnorm()` for more information about the `rnorm()` function.
-   Let's check it out!

# `rnorm()` and RStudio demo

## What have we learned? 

::: incremental

- The `rnorm()` function takes `n` random draws from a normal distribution with a center (`mean`) and spread (`sd`). 
  - These statistical details are not necessary for this class.

## What have we learned? 

- The `rnorm()` function takes `n` random draws from a normal distribution with a center (`mean`) and spread (`sd`). 
  - These statistical details are not necessary for this class. 

We could have written:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1)
```

## What have we learned?

  - These statistical details are not necessary for this class. 

We could have written:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1)
```

Or even:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## Arguments

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

::: incremental
-   `n` must be specified for `rnorm()` to run
-   `mean` and `sd` are optional, but if you don't specify them, `R` will choose for you (in this case, the defaults are `0` and `1`).

# `R` as a calculator

## `R` as a calculator

-   `R` includes many mathematical operations, and is a great calculator. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
2 + 3 # addition
2 * 3 # multiplication
2 / 3 # division
2 - 3 # subtraction
```

## `R` as a calculator

-   Functions exists for more complex mathematical operations

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1,2"
log(7) # the natural logarithm
log(7, base = 10) # log base 10
exp(7) # the exponential function
sqrt(7) # the square root function
abs(10 - 17) # absolute value
```

```

# Quarto

## Quarto 

::: incremental

-   Quarto is a markdown language, released in 2022.
-   Allows you to include code and text in the same document.
-   Documents output or "Render" to PDF or HTML (web) documents.
-   These slides (and the course website!) are made with Quarto. 

:::

## Quarto for reproducible reports

::: incremental

-   Quarto is a great tool to help us do reproducible science. 
-   What does reproducibility mean? 
-   reproducibility $\neq$ replicability / repeatability

:::

---

## A project is *reproducible* if another person could take your code and data, run the code, and get the exact same answer. 

## A project is *replicable / repeatable* if another person could take the steps to do your project again in their own setting. 



# Quarto demo


## Objects in `R`

-   `R` can store objects for use later in what we call an *environment*.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
dbh_in <- 40 # store tree diameter (inches)
```

```{r}
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("figs/assign-variable.png")
```

## Objects in `R` 

-   `R` can store objects for use later in what we call an *environment*.
-   Here, we stored `dbh_in` in our environment, and printed it out to see its value.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
dbh_in
```

## Objects in `R`

-   `R` can store objects for use later in what we call an *environment*.
-   Here, we stored `dbh_in` in our environment, and printed it out to see its value.
-   We can use `R` as a calculator to compute the tree's basal area.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
BA_in2 <- pi * (dbh_in / 2)^2 # compute tree basal area
BA_in2
```

## Next time

::: incremental

-   We'll talk about file systems, paths, folders, and navigating your computer.
-   More advanced features of `R` as well: basic data structures, variable naming and code formatting, reading/writing data, and more!
