## Agenda

-   Overview of data structures
-   A tour of vectors

## Data structures

-   A <span style="color:#4267B2;">data structure</span> is a format for organizing and storing data. The structure
is designed so that data can be accessed and worked with in specific ways.

-   Structures are either <span style="color:#4267B2;">homogeneous</span> or <span style="color:#4267B2;">heterogeneous</span>, which describes the
data types they hold (one type versus multiple types).

-   Structures can also be characterized by their dimensionality, see Table @tbl-str.


| Dimension | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
|------|------|------|
1 |Atomic vector |List
2 |Matrix |Data frame
N |Array|
