## Reading

Read the following sections of IFDAR. 

  - Chapter 1 (read sections 1.1 and 1.3 closely, you can skim 1.2) 
  - Begin Chapter 2 (STOP at the bottom of page 19)

## Tasks

### 1. Install `R` and RStudio

As discussed in IFDAR, go to [Posit's website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Install R first, and then install RStudio.

### 2. Run your first `R` command

In the console, type in the following command and press Enter to run it:

```{r}
#| eval: false
rnorm(1)
```

### 3. Record your result

Come to class on Thursday with a piece of paper with your name on it that includes the result (it will be a number) from running `rnorm(1)` in task 2.

If you were unable to install R and RStudio and ran into issues, instead come to class with a piece of paper with your name on it that explains the issue you were having with installation.
