## Questions

Consider the function:

```{r}
#| eval: false
my_pets <- function(species) {
  if (species == "dog") {
    return("Dude")
  } else if (species == "cat") {
    return(c("Pickle", "Kyle", "Nubs"))
  } else {
    return("Not my pet")
  }
}
```

1. What would `my_pets(species = "dog")` return?

2. What would  `my_pets(species = "bird")` return?

3. What would  `my_pets(species = "cat")` return?
