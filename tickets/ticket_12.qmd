## Reading

Read the following sections of IFDAR.

-   Review Chapter 6
-   Begin Chapter 7 (read the introduction and 7.1)


## Questions

1. You want to read in a file called "my_data.csv" on your computer and assign it to an object called `dat` in `R`. Now, we've learned two approaches to reading in data (base and `tidyverse`). How would you read it into `R` (a) with base and (b) with `tidyverse`? 

2. What are the `dplyr` verbs that we will learn in Chapter 7? What do each of them do?
