Read the following sections of IFDAR.

-   Chapter 7: sections 7.1 - 7.5


## Questions

1. Consider the following dataset:

```{r}
ten_cars <- head(mtcars, n = 10)
ten_cars
```

How would we use `dplyr` to filter for rows with horse power (hp) greater than 100? How would we use base `R` to do the same thing? Which do you prefer?
